The Indonesian Post Office provides a list of all post codes in Indonesia
here: http://kodepos.posindonesia.co.id/

There were no easy way to get a list of all post codes.

So I wrote some hackish code to download all pages, and then use a script to
extract all postcodes from the pages into a CSV file.

I don't include the pages here in the repository (they are about 87 MB).
